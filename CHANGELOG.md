## [0.2.0] — 2026-04-19

**Library polish aggregate — 14 findings surfaced by E142 L3 runtime test conversion, fixed in one batch.** Ships `aria-activedescendant` on editable comboboxes + selects (restoring WCAG SC 4.1.3), unblocks first-key keyboard activation on Select, fixes axe `list` violation on Toast, wires HoverCard into the shared Dialog escape stack, and resolves seven IMPORTANT keyboard / aria / focus-restore regressions discovered during L3a-L3e spec conversion.

### Fixed — library (ship in tarball)

#### CRITICAL (4)
- **F1 `components/complex/Combobox` + `components/complex/Select`** — hoisted `highlightedId` state from the former Content-scope provider (which rendered inside `FloatingPortal`, sibling of the trigger → sibling→sibling context propagation impossible) to the root context. `aria-activedescendant` on `<ComboboxInput>` / `<SelectTrigger>` now reconciles correctly on every highlight move. Restores WCAG SC 4.1.3 + APG `/combobox/`.
- **F2 `components/complex/Select`** — closed-state keyboard handler was early-returning on empty registry BEFORE the switch that would open the listbox, so the first-ever ArrowDown/ArrowUp/Home/End on a fresh trigger was silently swallowed (SelectItems only mount inside open-gated SelectContent, registry empty on first key). Guard reordered after open-intent cases. Open-intent keys now unconditionally set `open=true` per APG.
- **F3 `components/complex/Toast/Toaster`** — `<ol aria-label="Notifications">` held `<li role="status">` / `<li role="alert">` children. `role="alert"`/`"status"` strips `<li>`'s implicit `listitem` role, leaving the `<ol>` with disallowed children (axe rule `list`, wcag2a / wcag131). Fix: moved the status/alert role + `aria-live` + `aria-atomic` onto an INNER `<div>` inside each `<li>`; `<li>` uses `display: contents` so list semantics survive without altering the visual grid layout.
- **F4 `components/complex/HoverCard`** — inline `document.addEventListener('keydown')` Escape listener replaced with the shared `components/complex/Dialog/escapeStack` push/pop pattern. Nested modal scenarios (Dialog → HoverCard) now dismiss topmost-only on Escape, matching Dialog / AlertDialog / Drawer / Sheet behavior.

#### IMPORTANT (7)
- **F5 `components/complex/NavigationMenu`** — docblock claim "Focus on trigger: openImmediate" corrected to match runtime (focus updates roving tabindex only; opens are via Enter/Space/ArrowDown). Focus-open pattern rejected because it pops every submenu during Tab-through and collapses the Escape-restore flow.
- **F6 `components/complex/NavigationMenu`** — submenu-level `handleSubmenuKeyDown` ArrowRight/ArrowLeft/Tab branches now call `event.stopPropagation()`. Previously the event bubbled to the list-level handler and advanced an extra step, skipping a menubar item.
- **F7 `components/complex/ContextMenu`** — `previousActiveRef` focus-restore target was captured inside `useFloatingFocus` layout effect, which runs AFTER `mousedown` blurs the previously focused element (restore target was always `<body>`). New `preOpenFocusRef` snapshot fires on trigger `pointerdown` (button 2 only) BEFORE the blur, passed into `useFloatingFocus` via `getRestoreTarget`.
- **F8 `components/complex/Command`** — `commitHighlighted()` replaced the DOM `CustomEvent('cmd-select')` dispatch path with a direct React-side call through the registry's `onSelect` reference. The listener-attach race that lost Enter keydowns under Playwright (and by extension any automated harness or timing-sensitive user interaction) is gone.
- **F9 `components/complex/Command/Command.module.scss`** — `.shortcut` text color bumped from `var(--color-text-muted)` (#9d9d9d on surface-raised 3.88:1) to `var(--color-text-secondary)` (theme-aware, ≥4.5:1). Passes WCAG 1.4.3 AA.
- **F10 `components/complex/DatePicker`** — added internal `hasValidationError` state toggled by `commitSearch`'s invalid-parse branch, cleared on next user edit, merged into `aria-invalid` on the input (ORed with the explicit `invalid` prop). Auto-exposes bad-parse state to AT without consumer plumbing.
- **F11 `components/complex/Slider`** — `SliderThumb` `tabIndex` is always `0` regardless of `disabled`. Aligns runtime with the `@a11y` docblock and with the library convention (Select / Tabs / NavigationMenu): disabled-via-aria elements stay Tab-reachable for SR discovery.
- **F12 `components/complex/Slider`** — track-click thumb focus call (`onDragStart`) now wraps `thumb.focus({ preventScroll: true })` in `requestAnimationFrame`. Prevents the browser's own pointerdown focus dispatch (which can land on a descendant span) from winning over the thumb focus in prod bundles.

#### NITPICK (3)
- **F13 `components/complex/NavigationMenu`** — added `document.visibilitychange` + `window.blur` auto-close effect (active only while a submenu is open). Matches Radix NavigationMenu behavior, prevents stuck-open menus on alt-tab / tab-switch.
- **F14 `components/complex/DropdownMenu`** — docblock corrected: "Tab closes menu without focus restore" replaced with an accurate description of the trigger-first restore that `useFloatingFocus.getRestoreTarget` already performs. Doc-only.
- **F15 `components/complex/Calendar`** — intentional inconsistency between chevron buttons (native `disabled`) and grid cells (`aria-disabled`) documented with an inline comment explaining why the chevrons correctly keep the native attribute (they are not grid cells; native `disabled` delivers the Tab-skip behavior for free).

### Tests
- Replaced `data-highlighted` proxy assertions with real `aria-activedescendant` assertions across Combobox + Select suites (no longer needed after F1).
- Unskipped previously deferred tests: Select first-key-ever keyboard opens (F2), ContextMenu focus-restore (F7), DatePicker DP-R11 aria-invalid (F10), Slider SL-R05 track-click focus + SL-R22 disabled tabIndex (F11/F12), NavigationMenu NM-R20/R21 visibility+blur (F13), NavigationMenu ArrowRight-in-submenu (F6), Command CMD-R02 Enter commit (F8).
- Removed `.disableRules(['list'])` from Toast aria sweep (F3). Color-contrast rule still suppressed on `.description` pending a follow-up fix.

### Version bump
Minor bump (0.1.2 → 0.2.0): new tarball contents include semantic a11y changes to `SelectContext` / `ComboboxContext` (consumers reading the context type through re-exports would see the new `highlightedId` / `setHighlight` fields), new `preOpenFocusRef` on `ContextMenuContext`, and `hasValidationError` on `DatePickerContext`. Private contexts but strict minor-bump discipline applied.

## [0.1.2] — 2026-04-19

**Accessibility safety net — WCAG 2.1 AA zero-violations baseline for all 49 demo routes.**

### Added
- `tests/smoke.spec.ts` — Playwright + `@axe-core/playwright` smoke suite iterating every demo route with `wcag2a` + `wcag2aa` + `wcag21a` + `wcag21aa` tag set. Runs on `push` + `pull_request` via `.github/workflows/test.yml` and gates `publish.yml` before `npm publish`. Dev-only: `@playwright/test` `^1.59.1` + `@axe-core/playwright` + `@axe-core/react` land in `devDependencies` — consumer tarball unchanged (D5/D25 preserved).
- `app/playground.scss` — new playground-only entry that sets `$seed-brand: #06b6d4` + `$seed-accent: #8b5cf6` and ships shared prose styles (`<code>`, raw `<a>`) that the bare library doesn't own. Keeps the shipped fresh-template monochromatic seed intact for consumers while letting the dev playground render realistic AA-safe colors.
- `playwright.config.ts` — single Chromium project, `webServer: 'npm run build && npm run start'` (production build exercised, not dev HMR output), 180s cold-start timeout, CI-aware `workers: 4` + `retries: 2`.

### Fixed — library (ship in tarball)
- `components/layout/Section` — `bg="brand-subtle"` now resolves to theme-aware `var(--color-brand-subtle)` (brand-100 light / brand-900 dark) instead of the static `--color-brand-50` that rendered a pale teal band with light text in dark mode (~3.5:1).
- `components/complex/Carousel` — non-current slides use `inert` instead of `aria-hidden="true"`. Previous pattern violated WCAG 4.1.2 whenever slides contained focusable descendants (links, buttons). `inert` removes them from the a11y tree AND focus order in one attribute.
- `components/complex/Calendar` — weekday headers, selected cells, outside-month cells, and disabled cells retuned for AA: weekday → `text-secondary`, selected → `text-inverse` on brand (consistent with Button.variantPrimary), outside → `text-secondary + opacity 0.85`, disabled → `text-secondary + opacity 0.75 + line-through`.
- `components/complex/Tabs` — inactive trigger labels → `text-secondary` (was `text-muted`; failed AA on tablist surface-raised bg).
- `components/interactive/Label` — `.disabled` → `text-secondary + opacity 0.7` (was `muted + 0.6` = ~2.6:1; WCAG 1.4.3 exempts disabled but we match AA anyway).
- `components/interactive/Input` + `components/interactive/Textarea` — error messages use theme-aware `--color-error-strong` (red-700 light / red-300 dark) instead of raw `--color-error` (red-500 was ~3.7:1 on dark surface).
- `components/typography/Text` — `color="brand"` now resolves to theme-aware `--color-brand-strong` instead of raw `--color-brand-500`. Brand-strong is brand-700 in light, brand-300 in dark — keeps the semantic "brand tint" while hitting AA on card/raised surfaces.
- `styles/_generator.scss` — `$dark-text-muted` (neutral-500 → neutral-400) and `$light-text-muted` (neutral-500 → neutral-600) so `--color-text-muted` meets AA on page bg by default.

### Infrastructure
- `.github/workflows/test.yml` — 6-job DAG: `typecheck` + `lint` + `build` + `barrel` (parallel) → `smoke` (needs first three) → `e2e` (needs smoke; push-to-main only). Artifact upload for failing smoke runs.
- `.github/workflows/publish.yml` — extended with Playwright browser install + `npm run test:smoke` gate inserted between build and publish steps. Tag pushes now block on smoke green before `npm publish`.
- `app/_components/ThemeToggle.tsx` — refactor `useState`+`useEffect` → `useSyncExternalStore` (React 19 idiom; removes `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` ESLint violation that blocked CI green state during L1 infrastructure setup).

### Notes
- Smoke runs against the production build (`next build && next start`), not `next dev`. React hydration warnings that only surface in dev HMR don't gate CI; dedicated per-component suites in the upcoming L3a-L3e batches exercise dev-mode hydration behavior.
- This release closes the first half of the D25 debt (static-verified → smoke-guarded). Full "NVDA-qualified" signal lands in `0.2.0` after all 23 Phase 10+ components ship `.spec.ts` conversions (E142 L3-L5).

## [0.1.1] — 2026-04-17

### Added
- `LICENSE` file (MIT) — missing from `0.1.0` tarball despite `package.json` declaring `"license": "MIT"`.

### Fixed
- `styles/_project-settings.scss` inline usage comment showed an incorrect `@use '@bleizlabs/ui/styles/project-settings' with (...)` pattern that would double-load the module when consumers also imported `@bleizlabs/ui/styles`. Replaced with the correct `@use '@bleizlabs/ui/styles' with (...)` pattern.
- `README.md` Interactive category now lists all 18 exported components (previously missed `RadioGroupItem` and `InputGroupText`).
- `README.md` Display category methodology note clarified — Table ships as a family but counts as one primitive for the tally, matching the Card counting convention.

### Docs
- `context.md` Status, Scope, and "Poza zakresem" sections updated to reflect npm-primary distribution and `81/81 + @bleizlabs/ui@0.1.0` current reality.
- `ROADMAP.md` component counts bumped `80 → 81`, Phase 11 entry added, E140 listed as delivered.
- `CHANGELOG.md` header rewritten to reflect npm distribution.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-17

### Added — first private npm release (`@bleizlabs/ui@0.1.0` on GitHub Packages)

The library is now installable via `npm install @bleizlabs/ui` from the BleizLabs-scoped GitHub Packages registry. This closes Epic E140 (distribution sprint) and unblocks consumer adoption for internal BleizLabs projects.

**Package:**
- `name: @bleizlabs/ui`, `version: 0.1.0`, `publishConfig.registry: https://npm.pkg.github.com`, restricted access
- Ship-source model: TypeScript + SCSS published as-is, consumer transpiles via Next.js `transpilePackages`. No pre-compiled build step — changes ship verbatim, SCSS seeds remain overridable.
- `exports` map: root (`.`), `./styles` (all tokens), `./styles/project-settings` (seeds alone), `./styles/*` + `./components/*` passthrough.
- Peer dependencies: `react >= 19`, `react-dom >= 19`. Zero runtime UI dependencies.
- `files` whitelist: `components/`, `styles/`, `README.md`, `LICENSE` (playground excluded). 365 files, 389.8 kB packed, 1.6 MB unpacked.
- Root `components/index.ts` barrel re-exports all 81 components + utilities (`Slot`, `cn`, `mergeRefs`) + shared types (`SpaceIndex`, `ClassValue`, `SlotProps`).

**Consumer setup (documented in README):**
1. `.npmrc` with `@bleizlabs:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com` + personal access token with `read:packages` scope.
2. `npm install @bleizlabs/ui`.
3. `next.config.mjs`: `transpilePackages: ['@bleizlabs/ui']` + `sassOptions.loadPaths: [path.resolve(__dirname, 'node_modules/@bleizlabs/ui/styles')]` (second entry works around a known Next.js sass-loader + resolve-url-loader quirk that strips `./` prefixes from `@use`/`@forward` inside `node_modules`).
4. Import styles via `@use '@bleizlabs/ui/styles'` in a global SCSS file; import components from `'@bleizlabs/ui'`.

**Customisation:**
- Option A — override CSS custom properties in a `:root` block (works for every install mode).
- Option B — pass seed values via `@use '@bleizlabs/ui/styles' with ($seed-brand: X, $seed-accent: Y, ...)` for a deep rebrand that cascades through every generated scale. All 35 `$seed-*` variables carry `!default`.

**CI:**
- `.github/workflows/publish.yml` triggers on `v*.*.*` tag push — checks out the tag, installs deps with `npm ci`, type-checks, runs `next build` as a playground smoke test, verifies `package.json` version matches the tag, and publishes to GitHub Packages with `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN=${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}`. Workflow dispatch supported for re-running failed publishes.

**Internal refactors required to enable publish:**
- 134 internal `@/components/...` imports rewritten to relative paths across 70 files (path aliases don't resolve in consumer projects).
- 17 internal SCSS `@use 'mixins'`/`@forward 'project-settings'` imports rewritten to relative paths across 10 files (bare-name resolution fails inside consumer's `node_modules`).
- 35 `$seed-*` seeds tagged with `!default` to enable consumer-side `@use with (...)` overrides.

**Verified via throwaway test consumer** (`D:/tmp/bui-consumer/`) — local-tarball install + named imports + SCSS seed override + CSS variable override + Next.js 16.2 Turbopack build all green end-to-end before publish.

#### Tier A core (E15-E28 + E32-E33)
- **E15** Dialog (CI1) — first Complex Interactive, own `useFocusTrap` hook, APG `/dialog-modal/`
- **E16** AlertDialog (CI2) — blocking confirmation, `role="alertdialog"`, background `inert` toggle
- **E17** Drawer (CI3) — bottom-positioned, slide-up, iOS safe-area-inset, sticky footer
- **E18** Sheet (CI4) — 4-directional side panel (l/r/t/b), closes Drawer family
- **E19** Tooltip (CI6) — first modeless, introduced `utils/position.ts` + `utils/useFloating.ts`
- **E20** Popover (CI5) — first compound flat API, outside-click dismiss, modal opt-in
- **E21** DropdownMenu (CI7) — first accessible menu, typeahead + arrow cycling
- **E22** ContextMenu (CI8) — right-click menu, cursor-point positioning
- **E23** FloatingRoot refactor — extracted 5 primitives to `utils/floating/` (createFloatingContext + useFloatingState + useFloatingDismiss + useFloatingFocus + FloatingPortal), migrated 3 consumers zero-breaking
- **E24** HoverCard (CI9) — first E23 new-build consumer, grace area + HoverCardProvider
- **E25** NavigationMenu (CI10) — menubar, mixed dropdown + standalone Link items
- **E26** Tabs (CI11) — self-contained, zero floating primitives, roving tabindex
- **E27** Select (CI12) — first listbox sub-family, aria-activedescendant pattern
- **E28** Combobox (CI13) — second listbox, editable input + search filter + IME guard
- **E29** useFloatingValueState<T> refactor — 6th floating primitive, 4 consumer migrations
- **E32** Toast (CI15) — first notification sub-family, module-scoped event emitter
- **E33** Slider (CI14) — first drag-gesture consumer, APG `/slider/`

#### Tier B advanced (E30-E31 + E34-E38)
- **E30** Calendar (CI16) — first grid-pattern, `utils/date.ts` zero-dep date primitives
- **E31** DatePicker (CI17) — first composition Epic (Combobox + Calendar + FloatingPortal)
- **E34** Carousel (CI21) — second drag-gesture + first auto-rotation + first live-region
- **E35** ScrollArea (CI20) — third drag-gesture (triggered E39 Rule of Three)
- **E36** InputOTP (CI18) — shadcn/guilhermerodz idiom zero-dep reimplementation
- **E37** Command (CI19) — second composition Epic (Cmd+K palette) + useCommandShortcut hook
- **E38** Sidebar (CI22) — PHASE 10 FINISHER → 80/80, disclosure + plain nav, responsive desktop aside + mobile drawer

### Post-Phase-10 Consolidation Sprints (E39-E41) — 2026-04-18

- **E39** `usePointerDrag` refactor — Rule of Three from Slider/Carousel/ScrollArea → 7th shared primitive `utils/gesture/usePointerDrag.ts`. Unified PointerEvent + setPointerCapture drag. Zero-breaking migration, net -62 LOC library-wide.
- **E40** `useMatchMedia` refactor — Rule of Three from Carousel (PRM) / ScrollArea (coarse + PRM) / Sidebar (breakpoint) → 8th shared primitive `utils/match-media/useMatchMedia.ts`. Pure `(query) => boolean` via `useSyncExternalStore`, SSR-safe. Zero-breaking, net -14 LOC.
- **E41** Maintenance baseline audit — knip + depcheck + ts-prune scans + TypeScript strict config + `any` grep + bundle size verification. All findings false positives per copy-to-project distribution model. Verdict: library already top-quality, zero actionable fixes.

### Documentation Polish Sprint (E42-E46) — 2026-04-18

- **E42** ROADMAP Phase 4 resync (10 stale [ ] → [x] + 6 new E08 hardening rows) + `docs/_tmp/` promoted to `docs/specs/` archive (13 Phase 10 specs preserved for historical reference)

- **E45** component-inventory Phase 10 refresh (✓ markers + Epic column + utility primitives section) + JSDoc consistency sweep (4 earliest Phase 10 components E15-E18 back-filled with @layer/@tokens/@deps/@a11y/@apg/@tested/@regressions/@example tags; all 22 now have 8/8 tag coverage)
- **E46** CHANGELOG.md authored + v1.0-stable git tag + library freeze milestone
